What is the Difference between Fundam ental Rights and Directive  
Principles    
If a fundamental right is violated a citizen who is affected or anyone else in p ublic  
interest can approach a higher court and get it struck down  The Directive Principles  
are not binding on the state but these p rinciples must reflect in all state policies  
However if these are violated there is no right to go to court and get it s trike down    
  Which are the important provisions which protect dignity of  
women   
Article 21 which deals with right to life has  been expanded to include the right to  
Life with Dignity This provision has been invoked to safeguard the rights of women  
such as right to divorce to live a life free from violence and the right to safe  
abortions   
Article 51A of the Constitution lays do wn fundamental duties of all citizens It  
stipulates that all citizens have a duty to promote harmony and to renounce pract ices  
which are derogatory to the dignity of women   
  
Formal Equality and Substantive Equality   
One of the main pillars of the Indian Constitution is the principle of equality Article  
14 guarantees equality before law and equal protection of law to all its citizens   
Articles 15 1 and 16 2 expand this principle further and prohibit discriminatio n on  
the basis of religion race caste sex or place of birth This ensures that there is no  
discrimination between men and women upper castes and lower castes rich and 4  
  
   poor and all will be treated as equals before the law and will be provided equal  
protection of law   
Hence if any law is passed or any action is taken to prevent women fro m taking up  
employment in government or public sector undertaking such law or action by the  
concerned authority can be  struck down by the Supreme Court or a High Cour t as  
being against the Constitutional provisions Similarly paying women lower salarie s  
for doing the same work even when they are qualified for it is discriminatory and  
against the Constitutional guarantee of equality Similarly not employing dalits or  Muslims in certain categories of government jobs would also amount to  
discrimination   
But most important of all within the scheme of equality are Articles 153 4 and 16  
3 4 which help to further strengthen the concept of equality by permitting the state  
to make special provisions for securing the rights of the marginalized sections  
wome n children schedule castes and schedule tribes in order to help them to  
overcome the  discrimination they have suffered for many centuries and to help them  
to bec ome equal to others  This is called positive discrimination    
This has helped the state to  enact special laws for women and children such as the  
provisions for maintenance of women and children protection against domestic and  
sexual violence the Mate rnity Benefits Act special protection for women under all  
labour laws a special law to preve nt sexual harassment at workplace or reservations  
for women scheduled castes or scheduled tribes for jobs and in elected bodies A  
similarly a law to prevent at rocities against scheduled castes and scheduled tribes  
does not violate the provision of equa lity as it is meant to give additional protection  
to certain backward sections These are all beneficial legislations meant to improve  
the status of marginalized p eople    
  
  
  
Therefore while discrimination against women has been prohibited there is  
nothing to prevent the state from making laws to provide them with extra  
facilities or for taking precautions to prevent their exploitation  or abuse   
 5  
     Separation of  Powers   
1 Legislative  The Parliament of India  is the supreme legislative bod y  Composed  
of the President of India  and the houses  the Rajya Sabha  Council of States and  
the Lok Sabha  House of the People   
  
2 Executive The Prime Minister of India  as addressed in the Constitution of  
India is the chief of the government chief adviser to the President of India head  
of the Council of Ministers and the leader of the majority party in the parliament  
and leads the executive branch of the Government of India   
  
3 Judiciary There are various levels of judiciary in India   different  types of  
courts The Supreme Court of India  at the top followed by High Courts  of  
respec tive states with district judges sitting in District Courts  and Magistrates of  
Second Class and Civil Judge Junior Division at the bottom   
Checks and Bal ances   
The three bodies mentioned in the Constitution act in harmony with one and other  
The Legislature has the power to create and change the law  the Judiciary has the  
power to interpret the law and to ensure that  it is within the Constitutional  
framewo r k and the Executive has the power to put the law into action    
Power of Judicial Review   
The  judiciary has the power to interpret the Constitution and to review any law   
passed by the legislature and  executive order and to declare it void if it finds th at the  
same is in conflict with the Constitution   
This power is given by Article 32 to the Supreme Court and by Articles  226 and 227  
to the High Courts   Public Intere st Litigation and Habeas Corpus  6  
  
   What is Public Interest Litigation PIL How can it be used to protect the  
rights of marginalized people   
Our constitution gives all citizens the right to approach the court when their  
fundamental rights are violat ed  But in many instances the person or class of people  
whose rights are violated due to their  poverty illiteracy and socially disadvantaged  
position cannot approach the court to explain their plight as they lack the knowledge  
and resources to do so  M any a times social organizations a local NGO etc or a  
journalist may take the case and write a letter to the Supreme Court or file a petition  
in the Supreme Court on behalf of the person whose rights are violated  This  
procedure of allowing any other pe rson or organization to bring the fact of gross  
violation of rights of a disadvantaged group of  persons or an individual is called  
Public Interest Litigation The court verifies if it is done for personal gains or to  
advance a genuine cause  Sometimes t he courts have also acted on the basis of a  
newspaper report and have asked the government to exp lain the situation If any  
violations are noticed by the superior court strict action will be taken   
What is Habeas Corpus   How does this remedy protect th e rights of people   
Many a times when a person is arrested by police the family gets no further n ews  
about the person and sometimes the person dies in police custody due to torture So  
when details of a person who is arrested by police are not known the  relatives or  
friends can approach the High Court or the Supreme Court seeking the intervention  
of the court to direct the police to produce the missing person in court The exact  
meaning of these Latin words is produce the body and the actual meaning is  to  
produce the person physically in court or his body if he has been killed in police  custody T his is a very powerful weapon in the hands of the people against police  
atrocities    
  
2 Hierarchy  of Courts   
How are rights enforced  7  
  
   The rights located in the Constitution and in various laws are enforced by our courts   
The courts interpret the laws and apply them to the facts of each case The  
Constitution lays down the hierarchy of courts and also the role and functions of  
each c ourt  The lower courts are divided into civil and criminal Appeal from a lower  
court lies with court immediately above it Most states have a High Court Appeal  
from High Courts lie with the Supreme Court which is the highest court in India   
What is the h ierarchy of our courts   The following diagram shows the  
hierarchy of the courts in our country

   3 Explanation of some Legal Terms in Criminal  
Law   The criminal proceedings start with the filing of a complaint The power of the  
police officer to investigate the crime is based on whether the offence is of a serious  
type or a lesser serious type Accordingly the offences are categorized as bailable  
and non bailable cognizable and non cognizable and compoundable and non  
compoundable   
Difference between  a bailable and a non bailable Offence  If a person is arrested  
for a bail able offence the police can immediately release hi m on personal surety   
Heshe  does not have to be produced in court Non bailable offences are of a more  
serious type which invoke higher punishment imprisonment for a period of three or  
more years  In such cases the police does not have the power to grant bail  Serious  
crimes such as rape murder dowry death cruelty to wives etc come within its  
purview   However even in these cases when the accused person is produced  
before the magistra te heshe has a right to file an application for bail an d the  
magistrate has the power to grant himher bail If heshe does not have a lawyer the  
person is entitled to legal aid for the purpose of making this application   
If the person is apprehensive tha t he will be arrested for a criminal offence heshe  
file an application for anticipatory bail in advance and avoid the arrest for a limited  
period of time  If anticipatory bail is granted even if an FIR is registered the police  
will investigate the matte r without arresting the accused   
Difference between Cognizable and Non cognizable   
Offences are also further categorized as cognizable and non cognizable The  
following table provides the difference between these two types of offences   
Category  Cogniza ble  Noncognizable   
Seriousness of  
offence    When it is a serious offence  When it is a less serious  offence   
Police  
Investigation  Police will investigation  Police can investigate only by  
the order of a Magistrate  9  
  
   Register for  
Recording  FIR Register  NC Register   
Document copy  
you will get  FIR First Information  
Report  NC complaint   
Arrest  Accused  accomplice will be  
arrested without a warrant  
They can then apply for bail  
Bail will be granted at the  
discretion of the magistrate   
judge depending upon the  
gravity of the crime the  
chances of intimidating the  
witnesses or the type of  
influ ence the accused person  
has in the area  Accused  accomplice will not  
be arrested Police may call  
the accused  and warn him   
Outcome  The Police will investigate  
and collect evidence If there  is sufficient evidence they  
will file Charge Sheet and  
trial will commence  It creates evidence of the  
harassment the woman is  
facing   
Jurisdiction  In a cognizable o ffence the  
jurisdiction of the police  
station is immaterial to get a  
complaint registered under  
the FIR register  In order to get a non  
cognizable o ffence registered  
it is essential to ensure that the  
crime has taken within the  
jurisdiction of the  police  
station   
  
Offences such as rape sexual harassment of women or violating their modesty  
dowry death abetment to suicide cruelty to wives causing  grievous hurt etc are all  
cognizable offences where the police are bound to register the FIR and start the  
investigations   
If an offence is non cognizable then the police cannot start the investigations The  
person would have to approach the magistra te court and seek directions for the  
police to start the investigation Simple assault abuse etc come within this  
category  10  
     The main reason why an NC complaint is filed is to create a record proof of  
violence which will help the person in case the pe rson has to file a crim inal  
complaint later  For instance if the husband is abusive or threatens to throw the wife  
out of the house she can approach the  police station and register an NC complaint   
Later if she want to file for divorce on the ground o f cruelty the NC compla int will  
provide the proof that the woman was also subjected to cruelty and abuse earlier   
Compoundable and Non compoundable Offences   
The criminal law permits some minor offences to be compromised or settled   
between the partie s  A detailed list of t hese is provided under Section 320 of CrPC   
These are termed as compoundable offences  However major offences such as  
rape murder decoity dowry death cruelty to wives etc cannot be compromised  
between the parties Only the higher courts ie the concerned High Court or the  
Supreme Court has the auhority to compound these offences  Hence these are  
termed as non compoundable offences

   II RIGHTS WITHIN MARRIAGE   4 Matrimonial Rights of Women   
Introduction    
In India upon marriage women leave their parental homes and live in the home  
provided by the husband or by his family members This home is called her  
matrimonial home In fact traditionally it is believed that after marriage a woman  
has rights only in he r husbands home and not in her parental home though legally  
the position is now changed and today women have a right of residence in both  
parental as well as the matrimonial home    
The contract of marriage creates a legal obligation upon the husband and  his family  
members to provide a shelter and maintenance to the wife In our society a woman  
is perceived as a home maker in addition to all other roles she may be required to  
perform So while women have the burden of managing the house cooking for the  
family raising the children and tending to the sick their chances of earning an  
adequate income to support themselves or even the chances of retaining their pre  
marriage jobs are constrained Hence when economic support is withdrawn due to a  
matrimon ial  conflict most women are rendered destitute The situation becomes  
dismal when they have the additional burden of caring for their children Womens  
right to shelter and maintenance is located within this conceptual framework   
There are various legal provi sions which are meant to safeguard the rights of the  
wife in her husbands home and to ensure that she can live there with dignity and  
safety The husband and his family cannot deprive her of these rights They cannot  
harass a wife for dowry and infli ct v iolence upon her If a situation of domestic or  
sexual violence arises the wife can avail of legal remedies under criminal as well as  
civil laws The wife also has a right to file for divorce and opt out of the marriage   
She also has a right to custo dy of her children   National Insurance Co Ltd vs Minor Deepika  2009 6 MLJ 1005 Madras  
High Court   
  
The UNICEF in 2000 noted that unpaid care work is the foundation of  
human experience The care work is that which is done by a woman as a  
mother The  woman herself will be the last person to give this role an  
economic value But when we are evaluating the loss suffered by the child  
because her mother died in an accident we must give a monetary value to the 12  
  
   work of a caregiver for after all the home is the basic unit on which our  
civilized society rests   
  
Note   All women across religions and regions are entitled to the rights discussed  
below unless specifically mentioned otherwise   
a Right to live in the Matrim onial Home   
What is a matrimonial home   
When a woman is married she acquires the right to live in her husbands home This  
home becomes the womans matrimonial home Even if it is not owned by her  
husband and is in the name of his parents or siblings she s till has a right to reside in  
this house and she cannot be thrown out of this house  A widow cannot be thrown  
out from the house in which she was living with her husband after her husbands  
death It does not matter if the house was not owned by her husba nd   
The term used i n the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act  Domestic  
Violence Act or DV Act for short is shared household   
  A shared household  is where the woman resides or has resided ie has left or has  
been thrown out with the man in a domestic relationship S 2s of the DV Act     
  
It does not matter that the shared household is not owned by either the woman or the  
man ie the house is  on lease  license or joint family property This right is  
protected under  S 17 of the Domestic Violence Act If she is thrown out the court  
can pass an order to put her back in the home The court can also ask the respondent  
to provide alternative acco mmodation if the woman does not want to return to a  
violent  home   
  
How can a woman protect this right   
In order to protect this right a woman must first believe that by virtue of her  
marriage she has acquired a right to reside in her husbands home and she cannot be  
dispossessed from this home Most often women  lose their right to their matrimonial  
home because they themselves do not believe that they have a right to reside there  
Even when they are asked to leave the home they must believe that they have a right 13  
  
   to reside in the home and this right ca n be protected by law  This is the first step  
Only when women believe this the right can be protected by law   
If there is an apprehension that she will be thrown out of this house she must  
approach a magistrates court under the provisions of the  Domest ic Violence Act  
and obtain an order of injunction to restrain her husband or his family members from  
dispossessing her throwing her out from her matrimonial home Ss17 19 of DV  
Act This will secure her right of residence in this house In the event that t he  
husband or his family members violate this  order they will be liable for punishment  under the Domestic Violence Act S31 of DV Act     
A woman will be deprived of this right only when an alternate accommodation of a  
permanent nature is provided for h er  Until such time her right to reside in t he  
matrimonial home will be protected by the court   
Caution  The term right of residence cannot be construed to mean ownership  
rights or right to a share in the property Womens right to property is discussed  
under a separate section  In India we do not have a right to matrimonial property  
which is owned by the  husband or his family members However despite this  
limitation the right of residence is an important right for most women and this right  
is protected under the Domestic Violence Act   
b Right to claim Maintenance for self and children   
What is Mainten ance   
The law imposes a legal obligation on the husband to provide maintenance to his  
wife If he fails to provide for her the wife   can a pproach the court for an order of  
maintenance    
The term maintenance is the amount required for a decent living including cost of  
food shelter if the same is not provided by the husband travel requirements of  
health care educational extra curricular an d recreational expenses of children and  
other sundry expenses   
Who can claim maintenance   
Under our law the wife minor children major children who suffer from physical or  
mental disabilities unmarried major daughters and aged parents are entitled to  
maintenance as they are unable to maintain  themselves   
Can the wife claim maintenance for her children along with herself  14  
     Yes the wife can claim maintenance for herself and her children  If the children are  
living separately along with their mo ther they also have an independent right to  
claim  maintenance from their father   
If a woman is working can she still claim maintenance   
Even if a woman is working she can claim maintenance if her husbands income is  
substantially more than her income a nd she is unable to maintain herself or her  
childr en from that income  If the husband and wife are earning the same amount  
she cannot claim maintenance from him  But in such a situation women can claim  
maintenance for their children    
Can a woman who is living with her husband claim maintenance   
Yes if her husband is not providing her maintenance while she is living in the same  
house with him she has a right to claim maintenance   
Can women claim maintenance during divorce   
Yes If a woman files for divorce in the same petition she can also claim interim  
and permanent maintenance for herself and for her children  Along with this she  
also needs to make a separate application for interim maintenance which can be  
taken up at t he initial stage and decided so she will start getting some maintenance  
while her petition for divorce is pending in the court   
If her husband has filed for divorce as soon as she received the papers she can  
immediately file an application for interim m aintenance which will be heard and  
decided first as a preliminary issue   
Is a woman entitled to claim maintenance after her divorce   
Yes Even after divorce if she has not received a lump sum amount as alimony  
which is adequate to meet her expenses she can claim maintenance from her  
husband until she remarries   If during litigation the husband agrees to take the wife back will she still be  
entitled to maintenance   
Usually in order to prevent an order of maintenance being passed against him the  
husba nd may volunteer to take the wife back or may even file proceedings for  
restitution of c onjugal rights  If a woman is keen to reconcile with her husband  
she may accept this offer but if there is a history of violence then she must exercise 15  
  
   caut ion b efore accepting it because once an order is passed dismissing the petition  
on the ground that the parties have reconciled it will be difficult for the woman to  
start the proceedings all over again as it would be deemed that she has condoned or  
forgiven  the husband his earlier acts of cruelty    
Hence it is advisable to stipulate certain conditions or even keep the proceedings  
pending in the court for a few months to ensure that the husband is sincere in his  
offer of reconciliation and is not doi ng so  only to avoid payment of maintenance  
before the earlier petition is withdrawn   
What is the criterion to decide the amount of maintenance   
The amount of maintenance awarded should be sufficient to meet the regular  
household expenses childrens education al medical recreational expenses to pay  
the rent of the dwelling house etc  It should be sufficient to meet the basic needs of  
a person Here the standard of life that a person is used to is also taken into  
consider ation For instance if the husband i s very rich and the wife is used to that life  
style she will be given a higher amount than a person earning a modest income  
where the wife is used to a modest life Hence it is important to collect evidence to  
prove th e husbands lifestyle and income such as type of house area of the house  
type of car or two wheeler property details trips to foreign countries etc   The exact amount is decided as per the income of the husband and the needs of the  
wife and children   
Tips  Many a times  husbands try to s how that their earnings are far less than  
their actual income by showing old salary slips or by hiding their additional  
income So it is necessary for the wife to get all the information before  
approaching the court and  collect the necessary details  recent salary record  
bank statements income from business or from family property income tax  
returns etc   
  
Is it necessary to file for divorce while filing for maintenance   
No If the woman does not wish to file for divo rce she can make an application only  
for maintenance This can be done under the provisions of S125 CrPC or under the  
Domestic Violence Act without filing for divorce

   5 Rights of Mothers to Custody of Children   
Introduction    
Right of custody of their children is a very important concern for women facing  
domestic abuse Due to the fear of losing custody of their children many women  
continue to live in violent relationships and are afraid of taking legal recourse to end  
the vi o lence Since earlier the father was considered as the natural guardian there  
is a belief prevalent in society that the children belong to the husband and his family  
and the woman has no claim over them and that her role is confined to only taking  
care of  them When women leave their matrimonial home they are often  warned  that they will not be able to get custody of their children and further they will not be  
even able to meet them  But over years due to sustained struggle from the womens  
movement t he law is changed and today the woman is considered as the joint natural  
guardian of her children and also considered as the primary care taker of her  
children The courts also consider that she will be the best suited person to take care  
of her children   In this section womens right to custody and the ways in which this  
right can be secured is explained   
a Situations where custody of children becomes contentious  
and precautions which women must take   
  
What right do women as mothers have over their c hild ren   
A wife along with her husband has the right of custody and guardianship over her  
children  As the primary care taker of her children she is responsible for their care  
and protection Hence she is entitled to their custody and guardianship   
Whe n does the issue of custody of children arise   
The issue of custody of children arises if due to a dispute  between the spouses if  
either of the parties or both  wish to live separately from each other   
When she is separating from her husband how can th e woman retain the  
custody of her children   
If she is separating from her husband the best way to retain custody of the children  
is for the wife to take the children along with her when she is leaving her  
matrimonial home If the children are already re sidi ng with the mother usually  
interim custody will be retained with the mother even if the husband approaches the  
court for custody of the children  17  
     It is important for any one advising the woman eg lawyer NGO member  
counselor etc to give women accu rate advise regarding this to avoid unwarranted  
anxiety about the issue of securing the legal custody of their children later during  
court proceedings    
Why dont women usually take the children along with them   
This is because women think that if they t ake their children with them the husband  
may file a police complaint against them that they have kidnapped the children  
However the police have no right to do this as she is the mother and hence she is  
also the natural  guardian of her children A case o f kidnapping cannot be filed  
against a natural guardian   
Is it possible for the woman to take custody of her child after she has left the  
home   
If a woman has not taken her children with her when she is leaving the ho use it is  
possible to take the custod y later This can be done with the help of a member of a  
local Mahila Mandal   NGO  a social worker or the local police soon after she has  
left the home  If the child left behind is very young and cannot live without  the love  
and care of the mother o r if the woman is breast feeding her child this must be done  
at the earliest  If there is a long gap after the woman has left the home it will not be  
possible to take custody in this manner as the child may get used to  living with the  
father and his fa mily and may not wish to come with the mother In such a situation  
it is advisable to approach the court for appropriate orders   
  
Caution  If the child is attached to the husband or his mother and does not wish to  
com e with the mother it will not be possible to take the custody of the child Always  
remember that the childs wishes and wellbeing are the most important factors in  matters of c ustody   
Can the husband file a police complaint against her for kidnapping the child   
No if the child wants to be with the mother and the mother wishes to have the child  
with her the husband cannot file a case of kidnapping against her as she is the  
natural gua rdian of the child  However only the mother alone has a right to take  
custody of her child  No one else can do it on her behalf but a support person or a  
social worker can help her or accompany her  At times the police may refuse to help  
the w oman and may insist on a court order   
The Principle the best interest of the child is paramount  18  
  
   What is the main principle which the courts rely upon while deciding the matter  
of the custody of children   
The only principle which is applied while decidi ng the custody of children  the best  
interest of the child is important   This principle enshrined in the United Nations  
Declaration of the Rights of the Child is relied upon by Indian Courts while  
determining the parental rights for custody of children  This means the custody must  
be given to the person who is best suited to take care of the child or to the parent  
who is the primary caretaker of the child  In the Indian setting usually this person is  
the mother   
What factors are considered by the cou rt while deciding the best interests of  
the child   
The love and care given to the child is the most important factor The general growth  
of the child the childs well being progress in school childs own preference the  
atmosphere in the home  these are  s ome of the factors which are considered while  
deciding the best interests of the child    Generally whoever has physical custody of the child at the point of approaching the  
court usually gets to retain the custody However this rule is not rigid and  if the  
situation so demands custody can be changed from one parent to the other as per  
the court order  Usually if the child is older while changing the custody the court  
will ascertain the views of the child   
Caution  If a woman is facing domestic  violence and she is desirous of leaving her  
matrimonial home to escape from violence she must be given correct advice that she  
has a right to take her children along with her and that she does not require a court  
order to do this   
Is it true that the l aw considers the father as the natural guardian   of the  
children and hence his right over the children as superior to that of the mother   
No this is not true This was the belief earlier Within the patriarchal fam ily system  
the father was considered a s the head of the family and the natural guardian of the  
children Both the wife and the children belonged to the husband but gradually this  
belief changed Now our law considers both father and mother as equal partn ers in  
marriage and also considers them as equal guardians of their children The fathers  
rights over the child are not superior that of the mother However traditional values  
still prevail and many people still endorse this anti women view and legally in correct  
view  19  
  
   Is it true that the  mothers rights over the custody of a child under five years is  
superior to that of the father   
Yes this is true This is because a young child needs the love and care of the mother  
and hence the law considers that the mother is better equipped to look a fter a child of  
tender age The child may also be breast fed by the mother  Depriving the child of  the mothers love and care may cause great trauma and anxiety to the child In such  
cases if the mother is throw n out the police can help the mother to ge t immediate  
custody of the child  to save the child from being subjected to such trauma   
If the mother is employed will she still be given custody of the child   
This is a general misconception that prevails in society People feel that if the  
woman is e mployed she will not get custody of the child as she has no time to look  
after the child and the fathers mother may be more suitable to look after the child  
But this is not true The right of the mother is super ior to that of the husbands  
mother A wom an will not be deprived of the custody of the child just because she is  
working or has a demanding job   
If the father is very affluent and if the mother does not have sufficient means to  
bring up the child will she lose custody of the child   
Even if the father is very affluent a mother will not be deprived of the custody of her  
child only on this ground  It is usual in our society that the father has better financial  
resources in most c ases and the woman may have been a housewife all her life  She  
may not even have the requisite qualifications to earn an adequate income  But this  
factor alone cannot be taken into consideration while deciding the issue of custody of  
the child   The one  who is able to provide the best love and care for the child will b e  
the only deciding factor At times people feel that if the mother is unemployed she  
may not get custody as she does not have the financial resources to bring up the  
child However since  the legal obligation to provide for the child is primarily with  
the father the fact that the mother does not have sufficient means to provide for the  
child will not be considered as a major obstacle while awarding her the custody of  
her child    
So the  bottom line is that it does not matter if the woman is employed or  unemployed   
If the husband accuses the wife of committing adultery will she be entitled to  
claim custody of her children   
Accusing the wife of adultery or of loose moral character is t he usual ploy adopted  
by the husband or his lawyer to deprive the wife of her right to custody of children 20  
  
   because they are under a misconception that a woman who has committed adultery  
will not  be entitled to custody of her children But the fa ctual position is that the  
issue of custody of child will be decided only on who is the main care taker of the  
child what kind of environment the mother is able to provide for the well being of  
the child and not on whether she has committed any matrimon ial fault Since this  
ploy is used routinely by lawyers courts do not give it serious consideration  
However many women get traumatized when they find that such baseless  
allegations are leveled against the m It is best to ignore these allegations and focus  
on the core issues regarding custody   
If the mother remarries after her divorce will she lose the custody of her child   
No if she has been looking after the child wel l she will not lose custody when sh e  
remarries When the court decides on the matter of custody the court will look only  
at the best  interests of the child The childs wishes will be taken into consideration   
If the child is happy with the mother the mo ther will not be deprived of the custody  
of her child upon her remarriage Even the local or caste  panchayat or the jamaat  
cannot force the mother to give up the custody of her child upon her remarriage If  
this happens she must not comply with the order  and instead immediately must file  
an application for custody under the Domestic Violence Act and protect her rights   
Rights of a non custodial Parent   If custody of the child is given to one parent what right does the non custodial  
parent have   
It is important that the child has the love and care of both the parents  It is necessary  
for the healthy upbringing of a child  Hence if one parent is given custody the other  
parent will be given the right of access  This means if the child is living with th e  
mother the child may meet the father on a regular basis ie once a week on a  
Sunday or once a fortnight during the weekend etc Similarly during the holidays  
the father will be given some days to spend with the child Sometimes the holidays  
are divided equally between the parents Usually the court issues strict guidelines  
regarding the timings for access which both parties must strictly comply with   
What care should the parents take so that the child grows up in a healthy  
environment   
The p arent who  has custody of the child must look after the childs physical and  
emotional needs well so that the childs personality develops well The educational  
needs of the child are also an important factor and the parent who has custody must  
ensure that all educa tional needs of the child are met according to the standard of life  
enjoyed by the parents  21

proceedings  Though the final orders are supposed to be given within 60 days due  
to technical difficulties and w orkload of the court  this does not usually happen But  
the final order can be expected within one year of filing and an interim order can be  
expected at least within two months

III Violence Against Women  Children   
7 Dowry Harassment and Cruelty Against Wives   
What is the meaning of Dowry   
Section 2 of the Dowry Prohibition Act  DPA 1961 defines dowry as any cash  
jewelry  valuables or property which the husband or his family members demand  from the brides parents at the time of marriage as a consideration of marriage This  
term also includes demands made subsequent to the marriage from the bride or her  
parents   
Is dem anding dowry an offence   
Yes it is a serious offence under the Dowry Prohibition Act  1961  It is punishable  
with a minimum of five years imprisonment and a fine of Rs15 000  or equal to  
the value of the dowry demanded or paid   
Who can register a co mplaint under this Act   
The woman herself her parents the police Dowry Prohibition Officer appointed  
under S8 B of the Act or even a non governmental organization on behalf of the  
woman can register a complaint   
Which are the Provisions Related to  Do wry Related Violence in the  
Indian Penal Code IPC    
After the anti dowry in early 1980 several womens organisations demanded  
stringent punishment for husbands and their family members if they caused any  
dowry related violence to a newly married bride If a woman died in her matrimonial  
home within seven years under unnatural or suspicious circumstanced  a special  
legal provision was incorporated which is termed as S304B  Dowry Death  If a 26  
  
   woman committed suicide due to harassment for dowry within sev en years of her  
marriage S306 of IPC Abetment to Suicide can be invoked  If the woman was  
harassed for dowry or was treated with cruelty S498A  can be invoked In this case   
there is no limitation of seven years after marriage  If her stridhan is not  returned to  
her S406 can be invoked along with S498A The following table indicates the  
punishment that can be awarded under these sections   IPC  
Sections  Description of  
Offence  Maximum  
Punishmen t  Minimum

S406  Criminal

Despite widespread campaigns against dowry and t he stringent  
laws why has the menace grown   
In our society the social status awarded to the girls family is much lower than that  
awarded to the grooms family Since the need to get the daughters married is  
overwhelming the brides family is not able to refuse the demand for dowry at the  
time of marriage They fear that if they dont give dowry their daughters wont get  
married So the parents of the bride prefer to meet the demands of the grooms  
family in orde r to get their daughters married as having an unmarried daughter at  
home is con sidered a social stigma   
What is the remedy   
The problem is not with the gifts which are given to the bride from her parents or  from her husbands family The problem is that  the woman does not have control 27  
  
   over these items and they area considered as the  property of the husband and his  
family This attitude must be changed Girls must be advised that the gifts given at  
the time of marriage are her exclusive property  and if she has been forced to leave  
the matrimonial home due to domestic violence she has  a right to take these with  
her   
What precautionary measures must be taken at the time of  
marriage   
The girls parents must take the following precautions at the  time of their daughters  
marriage to secure her future   
 The girl and her family members must refuse the marriage proposal from a  
groom or his family members if they make demands for dowry at the time of  
marriage negotiations   
 The parents are free to  give gifts to their daughter at the time of marriage out of  
love and affection for her The gifts given by relatives friends and even by the  
husband or his relatives belong exclusively to the bride and constitutes her  
stridhan A list of these gifts rece ived at the time of marriage must be made and  
the bride the groom and their parents must sign this document and it must be  
kept safely with the girls family or a trusted friend so that there is no dispute  
regarding the gifts received as stridhan later   
 If after the marriage is arranged valuables or cash is dema nded as dowry or  
gifts the marriage preparations must be stopped and a complaint under the  
Dowry Prohibition Act must be immediately be registered See the later section  
regarding property rig hts of women for a further discussion on this issue    Rather than cash gifts relatives must be encouraged to give cheques in favour of  
the girl at the time of marriage and this should be deposited either in her own  
separate account or in a joint account  in the name of the bride and the groom   
 All valuables and jew elry which belongs to the bride must be kept in a locker  
which is in her exclusive name or which is in the joint names of herself and the  
groom which she has the right to operate  28  
  
    If after marriage the girl is harassed for more dowry she must communicat e this  
to her parents through letters or emails The parents of the girl may meet the  
groom and his family members to sort out the differences and if they cannot be  
resolved the g irl must be given a choice to return to her parents home   
 In the event tha t the bride is thrown out of her matrimonial home she must take  
with her all her jewelry and valuables   
 In case this is not possible at the time of leaving or soon thereafter s he must  
lodge a complaint to the police mentioning the fact of harassment fo r dowry and  
also give the police a list of valuables that are left behind in the husbands  
home The police can register a case under the Dowry Prohibition Act as well as  
under S498A and S406 of IPC and help the girl to immediately retrieve her  
belonging s and valuables from the husbands residence  These IPC provisions  
are discussed later in this section   
 If at this stage no compromise is possible the girl can also initiate p roceedings  
under the Domestic Violence Act for her civil rights such as maint enance  
residence return of belongings etc    
What is Stridhan   
The gifts given to the bride out of love and affection by her parents or relatives  constitute her stridhan The gifts given to the bride by her husband andor his  
relatives also constitute he r stridhan The term  Stridhan means  a womans  
property and she has exclusive control over it Even if it is kept with her husband or  
his parents wh en a woman demands it it must be given back to her   
How can a woman claim her Stridhan if it is in the  possession of her  
husband or in laws   
In many families the stridhan property is kept in the custody of the  mother inlaw  
or the husband  If they ref use to give it back to her when she demands or when she  
is leaving the matrimonial home  it is an off ence under S406 of IPC   Criminal  
Misappropriation of Trust  If the woman lodges a complaint with the police the 29  
  
   police will immediately call t he husband  his family members to the police station  
and request them to return the jewelry and valuables  If  they refuse the police will  
file a case under S406 of IPC and arrest them and also get an order to search and  
seize the valuables from the pre mises or bank lockers etc   
Criminal complaint against husband andor  in laws  for  causing  
cruelty   
What is cruelty to a wife under the Criminal Law      
Section 498A of IPC defines cruelty as follows  If a husband or his relatives harass  
a woman for d owry or cause any physical or mental harassment which causes harm  
to her life limb or sanity it amo unts to cruelty   
Is it a serious offence   
Yes It is a serious offence Though the maximum punishment is only three years  
the offence is cognizable non ba ilable and non compoundable The police have the  
power of immediate arrest even without a court wa rrant This causes a great deal of  humiliation to the husband and his family members Once filed the complaint cannot  
be withdrawn easily It can only be quas hed by the High Court Once a complaint  
under this section is filed it is difficult to reconcile  the marriage    
Can this section be used to address general physical and mental  
cruelty inflicted on a married woman   
Yes  This section can be used for dowry related harassment as well as for any  
physical or emotional harassment caused to the wife as it can be seen from the  
definition of this provision   
Section 498 A Husband or relatives of husband of a woman subject h  er to  
cruelty  Whoever being husband or the relative of the husband of a woman 30  
  
   subjects such women to cruelty shall be punished with imprisonment for a term  
which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine   
Explanation   for th e purpose of this section Cruelty means   
a any willful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely  to drive the woman to  
commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life limb or heath whether  
mental or physical of the woman or   
b harassme nt of the woman where such harassment is  with a view to coercing her  
or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any  property or  
valuable security or in on account of failure by her or any person related to her to  
meet such a demand   
  
What are the problems faced by women to register cases under this  
Section   
Usually the police refuse to register cases under this section unless specific  allegations of dowry demands are included in the complaint  But now slowly this  
misconception i s changi ng But even now the police do not register the case straight  
away The couple is first sent for counseling and the police only registers the  
complaint if the dispute is not resolved   
How can cruelty be proved   
Cruelty can be proved in various w ays such  as complaints to the police medical  
records letters written to her parents by the girl phone calls phone messages  
statements of friends or neighbours etc    
Is forced sex in marriage marital rape within the purview of this  
section  31  
  
   Yes forced se x amounts to sexual violence and is included within the term  
cruelty  So forced sex will come within the purview of this section and if there are  
any such complaints of this nature the police must immediately file the complaint  
and arre st the husband   Though S498A does not specifically define sexual violence  
as cruelty but uses broader general term as   any physical or mental harassment  
which causes harm to her life limb or sanity rape  sexual violence would come  
within its scope    
  
  
8  Rape  Sexual Offences Under I PC  
As Amended by the Criminal Law Amendment Act 2013   
Mathura the Catalyst of the anti rape campaign in India   
Mathura a 16 yearold poor orphan illiterate tribal girl was raped by two  
policemen within a police compo und in Desai Ganj a small village in Chandrapur  District of Maharashtra She was brought to the police station in the evening of 26  
March 1972 on  a complaint filed by her own brother that she had eloped with her  
lover At 1000 pm at night while her relat ives were waiting outside after the  
interrogation two policemen on duty Tukaram and Ganpat took her to a toilet  
within the compound of the po lice station and raped her  When the relatives called  
out to her she came out in a distorted state with a torn saree and informed them that  
the policemen had raped her Hearing the commotion people gathered and due to  
their pressure a case of rape was r egistered The medical report revealed that there  
were no marks of injury on her body and that the vagina admitt ed two fingers easily  
which implied that she was habituated to sexual intercourse Her age was stated as  
being between 14 and 16 years   
The sessions judge Chandrapur on 1 June 1974 acquitted the policemen on the  
ground that since there were no marks of injury Mathura must have consented He  
labeled her a shocking liar whose evidence was filled with falsehood The judge  
concluded that t hough sexual intercourse with the policemen was proved there was a  
world of di fference between sexual intercourse and rape    
In appeal based on the same evidence the Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court  
reversed the judgment and convicted the accus ed to rigorous imprisonment for five 32  
  
   years and held that passive or helpl ess surrender induced by threats or fear cannot  
be equated with free consent However in appeal the Supreme Court in  
September 1978 reversed this judgment upheld the judgment  of the Sessions Court  
and acquitted the accused on the ground that absence of injuries implies consent   
The judgment shocked some law teachers who wrote an open letter to the Chief  
Justice of India condemning it as they felt it would  snuff out all hope s of justice for  millions of Mathura s in the country in 1979  This open lett er gave birth to the anti  
rape campaign in India and resulted in amendments to the rape laws in 1983   
An important aspect of the amendment was that custodial rape rape in polic e  
custody prisons etc was made into an aggravated form of sexual crime warra nting  
severe punishment of a minimum of 10 years The Supreme Court ruling had  
highlighted the fact that in a rape trial it is extremely difficult for a woman to prove  
that she  did not consent beyond all reasonable doubt  as was required under the  
crim inal law The major demand of the campaign was that the onus of proving  
consent should shift from the prosecution to be accused  Accordingly the burden  
of proof regarding con sent was shifted for cases of custodial rape  Since then there  
have also been s everal changes in criminal procedures police manuals etc which  
have given strict guidelines that women cannot be arrested at night and that they  
cannot be retained in police  custody at night  But the stringent provisions did not  
have the desired impact  of reducing the incidents of rape in the country as the  
following graph reveals

Addressing Biases Clearing  Misconceptions and  
Understanding Precautionary Measures   
  
It is not your fault   In our society if a woman or child is raped  she is  
treated as an accused and made to suffer She is made to feel that it is her own  
fault that she got raped Her character conduct the way she dresses her past  
sexual history etc become suspect and she is blamed for the crime that is  
committed o n her Due to the stigma attached to rape the family is afraid of  
reporting it to the police There is also the fear that reporting the crime will  
diminish the chances o f the girl getting married and that the entire family will  
be humiliated and ostracize d  This is all the more true if the girl is poor or  
from a backward caste Hence as change agents it is important for us to spread  
the message that it is not the fault  of the victim that she is raped   
  
If we are aware of our rights understand the proced ures and take precautions  
the trauma faced by a victim  survivor during investigation and trial of a rape  
case will be reduced   
   
Preserve all evidence  As far as possible the victim should not have a bath  
or wash herself or wash the clothes that she w as wearing at the time of the  offence  It is very difficult to do this because the natural instinct after rape is 38  
  
   to clean ones self and also wash the clot hes to wipe out the feeling of  
violation that the offence of rape brings about The place where the  crime was  
committed also must not be disturbed This is important to collect the  
evidence to prove rape    
  
Do not delay filing the FIR  Due to the stigm a attached to the offence the  
family takes time to consider whether to report the offence to the pol ice or to  
hush up the matter There are several levels of consultations take place within  
the family and even at the community level The social status of  the rapists or  
his connection with authorities also matter If the rapist is wealthy or has high  
social standing and the victim is from a poor family there will be a great  
reluctance to report the crime  Similarly if he is a relative or a neighbor there   
will be reluctance Due to this sometimes cases are filed even after many days   
  
Caution Delay i n filing the complaint will result in loss of crucial evidence  
and due to this it may be difficult to prove the case in court later   
  
  
Go to a hospital directly and start treatment Instead of going to the police  
station the victim can to  directly to the hospital and get immediate medical  
treatment This will help not only to preserve crucial evidence against the  
accused but avert any i nfectious or dangerous disease and avert pregnancy  
Parents relatives friends social workers etc may a ccompany the victim for  the medical examination The FIR can be lodged from the hospital itself   
  
Anyone can get raped  It can happen anywhere  There i s a general belief  
that rape is committed only by strangers in lonely places and dark corners But  
the statistics for Maharashtra for 2012 reveal that 94 of the reported cases  
are by known persons Fathers step fathers uncles grandfathers broth ers  
broth er inlaw other relatives neighbors teachers doctors police  
boyfriends his friends etc are known to commit rape  Even husbands  
commit rape but this does not get recorded as rape but it can be filed as an  
offence under S498 A IPC  cruelty to wives   discu ssed later in the next  
session   
  
All rapes are not violent specially those committed by known persons   
Many times the fact that a young girl is raped is detected only when she is  
about 5 6 months pregnant When she approaches the ho spital to find out why  
she has missed her menstrual period the fact that the child is raped is  
detected So be alert  39  
  
     
Penetration by Penis into vagina is not important to prove rape  After the  
recent amendment to rape laws it is not important to prove  penetration of the  
penis into the vagina All other sexual activity such as inserting fingers or  
objects such as rods sticks etc into the vagina anus or inserting penis into  
anus or mouth oral s ex also constitutes rape The legal definitions are  
discussed in detail later     
The Victim need not go to the Police Station to lodge FIR a relative  
friend or social worker can lodge it The victim may be traumatized after  
the rape or she may be injured  or she may be very scared to go to the police  
station  and narrate the incident to the police   
  
Remember  there is no need for a victim to go to a police station personally  
to lodge the FIR  It can be lodged by any person on her behalf  This is the  
law and you must insist that the police will follow this and not force the victim  
to come to the police station to lodge the FIR if she is reluctant to do so   
  
Her statement can be recorded later at her home or any other place where she  
is comfortable   
Creating Awareness about Sexual Offences  The new amendment  to rape  
laws have listed out many types of sexual offences and mentioned different  
body parts We must also familiarize ourselves with pronouncing the names  
sexual organs such as ie breasts va gina buttocks thighs anus penis etc  
We usually feel em barrassed to utter these words and there is a cultural barrier  
against naming sexual organs But under the new law it is very important to  
describe the offence accurately by naming the concerned body  part while  
recording an FIR We cannot use general terms  such as izzat loota  or galat  
kaam kiya     
  
We should also teach our children to be aware of their body parts and how to  
protect themselves against sexual abuse and give confidence to them to report  it to their care takers teachers parents etc when they are sexually abused   
Only then will the  stigma attached to rape will be reduced   
  
Respect the sexual choices made by y oung women Many times when a  
young girl has an affair with a boy and the parents do not approve of it the  
girl runs away with the boy Although the parents are aware that the  girl has  
gone with her own choice they file a complaint against the boy for  
kidnapping and rape and get him arrested When the girl is brought back she is 40  
  
   pressurized into accepting the wishes of the parents and agrees to marry the  
boy of her choice Som etimes the girl refuses to accept the choice of their  
parents and ins ists on marrying the boy of her own choice and prefers to stay  
at a shelter home until she becomes major and is able to marry the boy  Such  
cases tend to get categorized as false cases  through no fault of the girl and  
due to this all girls become suspe ct when they wish to file a case of rape So  
avoid filing such cases This defeats the purpose for which we are all fighting  
 to protect the dignity of women     
  
A scheme for financial a ssistance and other support to Rape Victims  
Recently the National Legal Services Authority has drafted a comprehensive  
scheme for compensation to rape survivors  All state governments are bound  
to adopt the scheme drafted by Central Government   
Support to  Victims during Investigation and Trial After recent  
amendment s a government official can be designated as a support person to  
help the victim during the procedures of investigation and trial This person  can be a government officer from the department of Women and Child  
Development or an NGO m ember working with the government The victim  
can also have her own lawyer  If she has no financial resources she can ask  
the state to provide her a lawyer from the legal aid panel

   IV WOMENS HEALTH AND SAFETY   
10 MEDICAL TERMINATION OF  
PREGNANCY ACT   
Background of the Act   
The MTP Act passed by Parliament in 1971to permit legalized abortions Prior to  
1971 abortion was criminalized under Section 312 of the Indian Penal Code 1860  
except in cases where the procedure was necessary to save the womans life The  
Shah Committe e appointed by the Government of India carried out a  
comprehensive review of socio  cultural legal and medical aspects of abortion and  
in 1966 recommended legalizing abortion to protect  womens health and lives on  
both compassionate and medical grounds  It was also viewed as a population control  
measure The term Medical Termination of  Pregnancy MTP was used to counter  
opposition from socio religious groups who were averse to abortion   
How are womens reproductive rights protected   
Womens reproduc tive rights are protected under the Constitution The right to live  
under Article 21 inc lude the right to live in dignity which is inclusive of womens  
reproductive rights  ie the right to become pregnant to bear children to decide the  
number of child ren the right to have an abortion to use or not use contraceptives to  
be or not to be ster ilized to be or not to be a parent etc  A mothers right to  
preserve her own health is superior to the right of an unborn child   
Do women in India have a righ t to a legal abortion   Yes women in India do have the right to legal abortion  In many countrie s women  
had to struggle very hard to get this right  But in India a law was passed in 1971  
the Medical Termination of Pregnancy MTP Act to secure for women  the right to  
have legal and safe abortions in public hospitals This was done to curb the practic e  
of illegal abortions which were carried on rampantly by non medical professionals at  
a great risk to womens health   46  
  
     
What is an abortion   
Abortion is a medical procedure of removing the foetus from the uterus of a woman  
who is pregnant if she wishes not to have the child This procedure must be carried  
out only by registered medical practitioners who are authorized to do it under the  
MTP Act  and if not done in a proper condition it poses a risk to the womans life   
What  are the conditions under which a pregnancy can be  
terminated   
Pregnancy can be terminated in the first trimester within 12 weeks if a doctor is of  
the opinion that it is sa fe for the woman to undergo an abortion   Beyond 12 weeks  
and up to 20 weeks t he opinion of two doctors is required to perform the abortion   
Beyond that a pregnancy cannot be terminated as it is very risky and may cause harm  
or even death to the pregnan t mother Hence it can be performed only in an extreme  
situation when it is ne cessary to abort the foetus to save the life of the mother S3  
2 a and b   
  
While deciding whether or not to perform the abortion the doctors must ascertain the  
risk of harm to the health of the pregnant mother  The doctors permission to  perform the abo rtion must be recorded in writing   
Whose consent is required for terminatin g pregnancy   
If the woman is a major ie above 18 years she can consent to the abortion herself  
If it is a child below 18 years or the person is incapable of giving valid consent  if  
the person is of unsound mind the consent of the guardian is require d The consent  
of the husband is not required to undergo an abortion   
Can the authorities disclose information about the woman who  
undergoes abortion under the Act  47  
  
   No the doctors or the hospital authority cannot disclose to the public any  
information ab out the woman who undergoes termination of her pregnancy This  
information has to be kept confidential S7 1 c   
  
  
11 Pre Conception and Pre Natal Diagnostic  
Techniques    Regulation  Act PCPNDT 1994   
  
Why is the female foetus aborted in our society   
Indian society carries within it a tradition of male preference  The great urge to have  
boys coupled with a high cost of living has led to a rise in sex selectiv e abortions  
Unfortunately provisions of the MTP Act are frequently abused in that m any  
families invoke the Act to help them in carrying out abortions of female fetuses after  
conducting tests to determine the sex of the child using modern technology suc h as  
sonography The age old preference to have sons received a new boost due to this  
and gradually resulted in a skewed sex ratio   This Act was amended in 2002 and even pre conception techniques used  advertised  
to select the sex of the foetus even bef ore conception was banned     
What has the government done to curb this trend   
In order to curb this trend in 1994 Government passed a new law known as the Pre  
Conception and Pre Natal Diagnostic Techniques Regulation and Prevention of  
Misuse Act 1994 P CPNDT Act for short  Since these tests are important to detect  
foetal abnormalitie s and genetic defects the tests could not be banned they could  
only be regulated  Now the tests can be done only under very strict conditions and  
they cannot be used for the purpose of identifying and disclosing the sex of the  
unborn foetus   48  
  
   In order t o curb the practice it has now become necessary to register all sonography  
machines and also necessary to display very clearly that the hospital or the clinic  
does not disclose the sex of the unborn foetus   
  
What is the punishment for misusing the provis ions of this Act   
Performing such tests is punishable by upto 3 years of imprisonment and a fine of  
upto Rs10000  for the first offence and upto five years of imprisonment and a fine  
of upto Rs50000  for the subsequent offence  Any doctor doing such  a test is also  
liable to have his license for medical practice suspended for two years for the first  
offence and permanently after the second offence   S23   
  
Monitoring of Genetic Counseling Centres   
The PCPNDT Act provides for regulation of genetic counseling centers genetic  
laboratories and genetic clinics and also regulates pre natal diagnostic procedures  The medical professional running the genetic cen ter has to be registered under the  
PCPNDT Act   
1 It allows the use of prenatal diagnostic techn iques for the purpose of specific  
genetic abnormalities or disorders only and to put down a prohibition on the use of  
these techniques for determining the s ex of the fetus by any such person under the  
Act  
2 The Act also prohibits any kind of advertisement s on pre conception and pre natal  
sex determination of fetus or sex selection of fetus is prohibited The Act provides  
for three years imprisonment and f ine up to ten thousand rupees as punishment in  
contravention of the Act   
3 and representatives of women s welfare organization to exercise the power and  
performs the functions conferred on the board under the Act   
 49  
  
   What is regulation applied o n this centers

registered under this Act shall conduct or associate with or help in

   V Womens Rights under Labour Laws   
  
Introduction   The Constitution of India mandates that women must be treated as equals and  
prohibits any discrimination against women in all areas including education  
vocational training skill development and employment In order to ensure that  
women get a fair and ad equate opportunity of employment the constitution also  
mandates reservation for women in educational institutions and in employment in the  
public sector   
Our Constitution also protects the rights of women workers by ensuring that their  
health and safety is duly protected in the course of employment particul arly those of  
pregnant women and breast feeding mothers The Constitution also safeguards the  
dignity of women workers and ensures that they are provided a safe working  
environment free of sexual haras sment   
In order to fulfill the Constitutional manda te all labour laws contain special  
provisions regarding the health and safety of women workers by regulating their  
working hours and by reducing the burden women have to carry In order to ensure  
equality  the law also mandates that both men and women wi ll be paid the same  
wages for the same or similar type  of work  Recently a special law has been  
enacted to protect women against sexual harassment at the workplace  The rights of  
women under different la bour laws are discussed in this section

Also included is the Minimum Wages Act   
They are applicable only to women and have been enacted to provide special  
prote ction and safety for the special needs of women    
  
Does enacting special law for women amount to discrimination   
No enacting special laws for women does not amount to discrimination    
The power to enact special laws for women is given to the legislatu re under Article  
15 3 of the Constitution which stipulates that providing for additional safeguards to  
women is not discriminatory but will enhance the principle of equality  as it will  
help women to  overcome the wrongs they have suffered for centuries

the same wages for men and women if they perform the same work or work of a  
similar nat ure Even if it is being performed at different places the salary has to be  
the same  An employer cannot discriminate against women while recruiting unless  
employment of women is prohibited or restricted by law Thus in matters of  
recrui tment promotions training and transfer the employer is prohibited from  
discriminating against women   
 54  
     Who is responsible for ensuring that the provisions of the Act are strictly  
followed

EVOLUTION     
 Bhanwari Devi a social worker from Rajasthan During  her work she  
prevented the marriage of a one year girl in the communit y The issue was  
reported to the local complaints committee and no action was taken  
Bhanwari Devi was however subsequently gangraped by those are men   
 Vishaka Judgement and SC Guidel ines In the absence of a specific law in  
India the Supreme Court in t he Vishaka Judgment laid down certain  
guidelines making it mandatory for every employer to provide a mechanism  
to redress grievances pertaining to workplace sexual harassment   
 Who is  it Applicable to   
It Extends to the whole of India It applies to bo th the Organised  and  
unorganized sectors in India   
 What constitutes Sexual harassment   
As per the POSH Act sexual harassment includes unwelcome sexually  
tinted behaviour whether directly or by implication such as i physical  
contact and advances ii d emand or request for sexual favours iii making  
sexually coloured remarks iv showing pornography or v any other  
unwelcome physical verbal or non verbal conduct of a sexua l nature   
Dr Punita K Sodhi v Union of India  Ors WP C 3672009  CMS  
828 114262009   In 2010 the High Court of Delhi upheld the view that sexual harassment is a  
subjective experience and for that reason held A complete understanding of  
the comp lainants view requires an analysis of the different perspectives of  
men and w omen Conduct that many men consider unobjectionable may  
offend many women Men tend to view some forms of sexual harassment as  
harmless social interactions to which only o verly sensitive women would  
object The characteristically male view depicts sexual  harassment as 58  
  
   comparatively harmless amusement Men who are rarely victims of sexual  
assault may view sexual conduct in a vacuum without a full appreciation of  
the soc ial setting or the underlying threat of violence that a woman may  
perceive   
 How to Identify WORKPLACE   
Work place has to be understood in a wider connotation and not looked in a  
pedantic approach In   
Saurabh Kumar Mallick v Comptroller  Auditor Gener al of India  The  
word  Work place has been objectively defined The test lai d down  
includes 1Proximity from the place of work  2Control of the management  
over such a placeresidence where the working woman is residing and 3   
Such a residence has to be an extension or contiguous part of the working  
place   
  
  
 What are my Relie fs   
The Complainant has the option to file a written complaint to ICCLCC  Either she can demand an enquiry into the matter or choose to conciliate In  
case of the former the Comp laints committee has to conduct a detailed  
investigation within the workplace and declare their judgement along with  
the recommendations to the employer   
The Complaints Committee has the discretion to suggest the penalties after  
having heard both the part ies   
Any aggrieved Party also has a rig ht to appeal against the order of the  
ICCLCC for further reliefs under this Act   
  
 Where should the complaint be filed   
An important feature of the POSH Act is that it envisages the setting up of a  
grievance redres sal forum   
INTERNAL COMPLAINTS COMM ITTEE  ORGANISED SECTOR  59  
  
   The POSH Act requires an employer to set up an internal complaints  
committee ICC at each office or branch of an organization employing  
10 or more employees to hear and redress grievances pertaining to sexual  
harassment   
LOCAL COMPLAINTS COMMITTEE  UNORGANISED SECTOR   
 At the district level the Government is required to set up a local complaints  
committee LCC to investigate and redress complaints of sexual  
harassment from the unorga nized sector or from establishments  where the  
ICC has not been constituted on account of the establishment having less than  
10 employees or if the complaint is against the employer

   VI OTHER ACTS   
16 The Schedule Caste and Scheduled Tribes  
Prevention of Atrocities Act    
What is the objective of this Act   
It was enacted to prevent the commission of offences of atrocities against the  
members of Scheduled Castes and Tribes and to provide for Special Courts for the  trial of such offences and for the relief and rehabilitation of the victims of such  
offenses   
The Act Protects the Marginalized Communities against discrimination and  
atrocities For example footwear garlands parading them naked dumping ga rbage at  
premises owned by SCST Further it also provides rehabilitation to the victims of  
such offences and discrimination by providing an equal opportunity in the field of  
education an d employment    
Who can file a complaint   
Any scheduled caste or sche duled tribe who is identified accordingly under the law  
HeShe should be aggrieved and experienced physical Mental psychological  
emotional or monetary harm or harm to his property as a  result of the commission of  
any discrimination or atrocities Any r elative legal guardian and legal heirs of the  
victim are also protected under the law   
What reliefs can be sought   
 He She can be protected from social disabilities such as denial of   
 access to certain public places   
 to use the customary passage without  being boycotted   
 personal atrocities like forceful drinking or eating of inedible food   
 sexual exploitation of SCST  63  
  
    Bodily injury etc   
 One can also be protected fro m atrocities affecting the properties malicious  
prosecution political disabilities a nd economic exploitation   
Where can they file a complaint   
 The SC and ST Act 1989 empowers the state government to set up special courts  and        exclusive special courts in every district to dispose off within 2 months or as  
far as possible from th e date of filing chargesheet The Act also provides a right to  
appeal in case of being aggrieved by the order of the Special court and Exclu sive  
Special Court The State government also is empowered to ensure effective  
implementation of the Act   
 Protectio n of witnesses and victims  The SC and ST Act 1989 has laid down  
all the rights of the victims and witnesses in order to curb such viole nce It  
also aims at encouraging its reporting for fair and just implementation of law   
 Crimes Against SC and ST  Violence against SCST is very nuanced in  
nature so it is difficult to separate atrocities against SCST from law and order  
problems So in m any instances the case is registered under IPC or CrPC than  
PoA  
  
Atrocities are in various forms such as cow vigilantism most dalits are in the  
occupation of leather making hides of the cow  honour killing social boycott Khap  
Panchayat caste clashes d iscrimination in Universities Rohit Vemula case    
Though th e SC ST Prevention of Atrocities Act is very stringent  most cases end in  
acquittal due to police lethargy and due to destruction of evidence of the crime  Also  
eye witnesses do not come forwar d to testify against powerful upper caste men   
  
Examples  of Atrocities  in Independent  India   
 Kizhavenmani Tamil Nadu 1958  in which 44 SCs were burnt to death in a  
confined building because SC agricultural labourers sought a little raise in their  
very low wages The high court acquitted all the accused  64  
      Karamchedu  Andhra Pradesh 1984  Five SCs were massacred The trial  
court convicted many of the accused The high court acquitted all  The Supreme  
Court  upheld the trial court judgment  a clea r example that acquittals do not  
mean false cases   
 Tsunduru Andhra Pradesh 1991  Eight SCs were massacred The trial court  
convicted the accused in 2007 The high court acquitted them in 2014 The  
Supreme Co urt has admitted a special leave petition SLP  of the surviving  
victims and survivors of victims   
 Six cases of  Bihar  including the  Bathani Tola 1996 and Laxmanpur Bathe  
1997  In most of these the trial court convicted the accused In all of these the   
high court acquitted the accused Appeals are  pending in the Supreme Court   
 Kambalapalli Karnataka  The prime witness in this case who is the sole  
survivor and head of the family whose other members were massacred turned  
hostile due to a threat of li fe resulting in the acquittal of all the accu sed  
  
Sexual Violence on Dalit Women   
Rape murder and maiming of dalit women by upper caste men as retaliation for  
aspirations of the community for economic and social progress  still continues in the  
villages and towns of independent India Lower caste  women are raped as part of  
caste customs and village traditions and are forced to have sex with upper caste  
landlords and the police Rape is often used as a form of retaliation to suppress  
movements demand ing payment of minimum wages   
These are not isol ated incidents but  routine occurrences One hears of several such  
examples of maintaining the social hierarchy of gendered citizenship For instance  
during the period of 1300 days from Dec 7 2003 to June 3 0 2007 1217 gang rapes  were reported in the Madhya Pradesh as per the State Assembly records  Out of  
these 362 cases were of women from scheduled castes 310 were of women from  
scheduled tribes and 381 were of women from other backward castes  65  
  
   An example of this social hierarchy of gendered citiz enship through which rights get  
constituted  is that while the Constitution empowered  women through reservations  
to local panchayats by enacting the 73rd and 74th amendments to the Constitution  
newspapers continue to carry reports of dalit women sarpanc hes panchayat heads  
being paraded naked and humiliated for holding these positions  Rape of dalit  
women continues to be a common occurrence with around 1172 dalit women having  
been raped during  the year 2005 as reflected in the statistics compiled by t he  
National Crime Record Bureau    
Another report revealed that rape of Dalit women in Gujarat rose by 500 per cent  
since 2001 over the last 13 years reaching a high point in 2014 While in 2001 only  
14 Dalit women reported rape in 2014 there were 74 Dal it women who reported  
rape and their cases were registered under the provisions of the Indian Penal Code  
and Scheduled Castes  Scheduled Tribes Prevention of Atrocities Act popularly  
referred to as Atrocities Act   
While most of these violations go u nchecked the gruesome killing of a dalit woman  
along with her seventeen year old daughter and two sons in Khairlanji village in  
Bhandara district of Maharashtra in September 2006 made national he adlines when  
six people were convicted with death penalty and two with a sentence of life  
imprisonment by the sessions judge at Bhandara in September 2008 This was a  
major landmark victory for dalit and human rights activists Despite this it is clear  
that issues concerning both gender and caste were invisibal ised in the judicial  discourse  As far as caste issues are concerned the accused were charged with  
murder under section 302 of the IPC but were acquitted of charges under Atrocities  
Act The acti vists felt that this glossed over the atrocities committed  upon citizens  
solely due to their caste positions In August 2010 the Nagpur Bench of Mumbai  
High Court upheld the Sessions Court ruling which had termed the atrocities as  
mere criminal acts com mitted out of human rage leading to a non application of t he  
provisions of Atrocities Act   
The invisibalisation of gender occurred when the courts negated the sexual abuse of  
the women Despite the fact that preliminary investigations revealed that the mother 66  
  
   Surekha and the daughter Priyanka were sexually abuse d prior to their killings the  
sexual violence inflicted upon the two women did not receive due judicial  
recognition both at the Sessions Court as well as the  High Court This despite the  
fact that the body of Priyanka was found stripped of all clothes T he High Court  
concluded that since revenge was the motive there was no intention on the part of  
the acc used to insult the deceased women or to dishonour or outrage their modesty   
While both gender and caste were invisibalised only the crime of murder whi ch  
comes within the ambit of Section 302 of the IPC was upheld While the Sessions  
Court declared that  it was a rarest of rare case warranting death penalty at the High  
Court level even the rarest of rare crime was further diluted into an ordinary  
murde r warranting only life imprisonment   
As this case highlights while the sexual brutalities committed o n dalit and tribal  
women are on the increase rape and sexual abuse of lower caste and marginalized  
women are seldom examined within the matrix of the in tersectionality of caste and  
gender The reported cases constitute only the tip of the iceberg as a l arge number of  cases do not even get recorded Even those reported and charge sheeted seldom  
result in conviction  The Khairlanji verdict is a rare judici al occurrence A  
combination of factors contributes to this dismal state of affairs Non accessibilit y of  
the justice delivery system to marginalised communities due to factors of poverty  
illiteracy and fear of the police is one contributory factor Insti tutional bias of state  
agencies against dalits leading to biased and callous investigation and pros ecution is  
another Retraction by eye witnesses from the higher castes is yet another factor The  
caste and gender bias in courts of law is a further contri buting factor

Issues around working of NCW   
The Major Issues around working of the National Commission for Women are as  
follows   
 NCWs functions are dependent on the grants offered by the central  
government Financial assistance  provided to the Commission is inadequate  
to meet its needs   
 NCWs members are appointed by the government and the commission does  
not have power to sele ct its own members   
 NCW lacks concrete legislative power It enjoys power only to recommend  
amendments and submit reports   
 The recommendations of the NCW are not binding on the Union or state  
governments   
 Often it takes action only of the issues are  brought to light Unreported cases  
of suppression and oppression are generally ignored by the Commission   
 NCWs jurisdiction is not operative in Jammu and Kashmir   
Drawbacks   
 It has no actual legislative powers It only has the powers to suggest amendm ents  
and submit reports which are not obligatory on state or Union Governments   
 It does not have the power to choose its own members The power selecting  
members is vested with the Union Government and the nature of countrys  volatile political scenario  tends the commission to be politicized   
 It is reliant on financial assistance from the Union Government and this  could  
compromise the independence of the Commission  72
